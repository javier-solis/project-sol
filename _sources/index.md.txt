# Welcome to Project Sol

Project Sol is a project geared towards introducing students and newcomers to advanced camera-based and robotics-based topics. This project is centered around the Robot Operating System (better known as [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)), a robotic software that facilitates the flow of information between different microcontrollers and computers. The content of this website will teach you how to set up and work with ROS via a well documented project based on Intel's RealSense Depth Camera. No prerequisite knowledge is expected.

This project is currently being maintained by Javier Solis, a MIT undergraduate student. You can read more about me [here](about-me)!
