# Helpful Ubuntu Notes

Over the course of this project, I spent a lot of time learning how to navigate Linux as well as learning new software development tips and tricks. To streamline my understanding, I decided to compile most of what I learned into an assortment of notes.  

[**Here**](https://github.com/javier-solis/notes/) you can find my notes, most of which I continue to actively update! I hope these serve of tremendous help as you begin your new journey into Linux. I've also included stylistic and perfomance changes you can check out to customize your Ubuntu experience.
