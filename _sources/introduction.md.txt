# Introduction


Throughout this website, I will help you gain a better understanding of ROS through an implementation that uses Intelâ€™s RealSense D435i Camera and Nvidia's Jetson Nano. Specifically, we will begin by getting you situated with obtaining, understanding, and testing ROS; build our way towards making a mobile Jetson Nano bot that the camera is attached to; and program that bot such that it can carefully navigate its environment and generate a 3D map of it (what is known as [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping)). Additionally, we will have the Jetson wirelessly relay snippets of this data to an Ubuntu laptop, for sure in AI applications like human and object detection.


All said, if you happen to spot any errors/typos on this website I would  highly appreciate if you were to let me know! You can do so by making a pull request on this website's [Github](https://github.com/javier-solis/project-sol) or you can let me know via my contact information highlighted [here](about-me.html#contact-info).
