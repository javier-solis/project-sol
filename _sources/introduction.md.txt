# Introduction


[A longer description of what Project Sol is about, and a summary of what I hope others learn/get out of this platform]

[Debrief about how I started this project, including a brief overview of the Snitch group and my supervisor Ed]

[Explain what the one documented project is about (it's a mobile robot that uses visual odometry to move around and recognize objects I think]


Also!!  
If you spot any errors/typos, it would be greatly appreciated if you let me know :D  
You can do so by making a pull request on the specific Sphinx source file or you can email me at _javsolis (dot) mit (dot) edu_  
Thank you!
