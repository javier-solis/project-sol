## Why the name Project Sol?
The naming for this project came about thanks partly to Arnau. When asking him for project name suggestions, 
he suggested "Solo" since "solo" means "alone" in Spanish and I was essential a one man team (still am) on 
this project. With his suggestion in mind, I realized that my last name, Solis, matched with the first letters 
of "solo", making "Sol". Thinking about it more, I started to like this name not just because of its match with 
my last name, but also because "Sol" means "Sun" in Spanish, and what does the Sun do? It give off light, allowing 
us to see and have _vision_. And since my project deals with _visual_ data processing, I found the naming fitting!


## Why that logo?

As you could tell, my logo resembles the Sun, adhering to the "sol" part of my
project name. As for the hexagonal shape of the Sun's rays, I found it aestheti
cally pleasing as hexagons are wonderful shapes. In fact, CPG Gray has much to say abo
ut it in [_Hexagons are the Bestagons_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY)!
