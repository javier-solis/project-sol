# Helpful Ubuntu Notes

Over the course of this project, I spent a lot of time learning how to navigate Linux as well as learning new software development tips and tricks. To streamline my understanding, I decided to compile most of what I learned into sorted files and subdivisions within those files. [**Here**](https://github.com/javier-solis/notes/) you can find these files, most of which I continue to actively update! I hope these serve of tremendous help as you begin your new journey into Ubuntu.
