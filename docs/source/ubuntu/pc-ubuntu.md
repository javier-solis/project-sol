# Ubuntu On Laptop

I recommend installing Ubuntu as a dual boot to your existing operating system. This will allow you to keep your current workflow intact, only having to use Ubuntu for this project. Another option you have is to install Ubuntu on an old but decent laptop you aren't using (think built post 2015). Either case will work.

```{note}
If you're using a macOS device, it may be a challenge to dual boot. I'm unfamiliar with the process related to macOS and therefore I strongly suggest using a Windows/Linux computer.

The specific file you'll want to download can be found in either of these links:
 
* [http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.5/](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.5/)
* [http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/18.04.4/](http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/18.04.4/) 

But remember to download the _desktop_ version! Once ready, I recommend following Ubuntuâ€™s official installation instructions. The first 
step of **creating** an installation USB-drive on a Windows PC can be found 
[here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview). The second step of **using** the installation drive can be found [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#5-prepare-to-install-ubuntu).   

In terms of specific settings to have, feel free to follow the recommendations they have, those are fine.
