# About Me

My name is Javier Solis, and I am a 2024 undergraduate student from MIT. I'm also a first-generation college student that grew up on a suburub outside Chicago, IL. 

During the Spring and Summer terms of 2021, Project Sol was the focus of my UROP under Ed Moriarty. You can read more about Ed and all the wonderful people that helped me with this project over at the [thank you page](thanks). Most of my work was carried out in room 4-409 of the Edgerton Center, and individual studying at home. Although this project is far from finished, I hope that the work I've put into it so far is of great use for you, the reader. Below are a few of my contact information, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
