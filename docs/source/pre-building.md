# Pre-Building

Although actual building will take place quite a few steps later, there are some essential modifications we must take on our Jetson Nano
before working with it.  

One of these additions is the installation of a Wi-Fi module on the Jetson. Instead of repeating information, a nice guide for this can be found [here](https://www.jetsonhacks.com/2019/04/08/jetson-nano-intel-wifi-and-bluetooth/)!

Another addition that has to be carried out is maximizing the amount of power that the Jetson can take in. To do this, a specific header pin must be removed. An external guide can be found [here](https://www.jetsonhacks.com/2019/04/10/jetson-nano-use-more-power/).
