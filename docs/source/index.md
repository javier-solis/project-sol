# Welcome to Project Sol!

Project Sol is a high-level platform made for supporting advanced camera-based and robotics-based student projects. This platform is centered around the Robotics Operating System (better known as ROS), a software that facilitates the flow of information between different microcontrollers and computers. Specifically, this platform contains a simplified tutorial on how to begin working with ROS, a section for common issues people will encounter alongside their fixes, one well documented starter project based on Intel's RealSense Depth Camera, and a forum where people can share their own documented ROS projects and share a sense of community.  

Currently, this platform is being developed solely by Javier Solis, an undergraduate student of MIT's class of 2024.
