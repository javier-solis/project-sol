# Materials

Outlined below are three lists concerning the materials that I used for this project, as well as places where you can acquire them. Please don't feel obligated to understand what each part does now, I decided to share this page early on in the guide so that you can have a glimpse and plan ahead accordingly.  

The _primary_ list is purchased materials, which are parts that I requested [Ed](thanks.html#three-key-individuals) buy. The _secondary_ list is parts that were already in [4-409](thanks.html#organizations-groups). Many of those came from miscellaneous sources and thus I decided to not include their product links. The _tertiary_ list contains files of 3D objects and SVG outlines that I custom-made for 3D printing and laser cutting, respectively.

```{warning}
For the first few steps of the guide you will immediately need the first 5 items on the primary list
```
